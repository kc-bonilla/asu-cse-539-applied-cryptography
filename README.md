Cryptography provides the underlying security methods for the web and many other computer applications. This course covers the design usage of cryptographic protocols for online and offline computing applications. Assuring the quality, validity and privacy of information is one of the key applications of Cryptography. Applications of cryptography range from signatures and certificates to trustless multiparty computations. Specific topics covered include:

    Large Numbers, Random Numbers, Hash Functions and Number Theory
    Encryption Methods and Common Ciphers
    Password Storage and Password Cracking
    Authentication, Key Exchange and Man in the Middle (MITM) Attacks
    Secure messaging, Kerberos and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Level Security (TLS)
    RSA and why it works
    Advanced Cryptographic Protocols
    Anonymity, money and secure election algorithms
